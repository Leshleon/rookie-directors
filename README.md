# Rookie Directors & Market Reaction
This project explores the market reaction to the appointment of rookie directors using event studies and statistical analysis in Python. The project encapsulates multiple levels of data wrangling and transformation before conducting analysis, to get a better view of certain necessary characteristics of existing or generated data points.

---

## Objectives
- Transform director level data to output important variables like skills, past directorships, closing balance of directorships, etc.
- Use PCA (PRinciple Component Analysis) to generate General Ability Index of Directors based on skills, experience, etc.
- Tranform the above outputs to extract firm level board chareacteristics.
- Conduct firm level PSM and director level PSM analysis on various dependent variables and extract their statistical significance for study.

## Methodology Overview
Each step in this project is clearly separated as sub folders within the root. This is to maintain efficiency and exit points for data extraction and inference whenever needed.
1. **Director level data wrangling and transformation**
   - Merge and clean director and firm-level data.
   - Use PCA to generate control-treatment pairs on IsRookieIndep
   - Match pairs using nearest neighbours approach, with replacement and generate the principle component n=1.
2. **Firm level data wrangling and transformation**
   - Conduct multiple levels of transformations to get firm level characteristics, and merge firm level financial data
   - Conduct further transformation to output City level characteristics.
3. **Event Study using PSM on a number of exogenous variables for Director level data**
   - Calculate CAR using CAPM and FF3.
   - Perform T-tests for statistical significance on Rookie Director Appointments on Director level data.
4. **Event Study using PSM on a number of exogenous variables for Firm level data**
   - Calculate CAR using CAPM and FF3.
   - Perform T-tests for statistical significance on % Rookie Director Appointments on firm level data.
   - Study statistical significance on multiple dependent variables
